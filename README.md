# Everydays
This repo will hold small programs.  
These programs are all coded from start to finish everyday.
The purpose of the Everyday project is to help me become a better software developer.

By posting the programs online, I'm "less" likely to push a big pile of ass-shit
even though most of the time I still do because I suck ass.

I am currently on my 1st round of everydays. In 2022 I'll code a small Rust program everyday.
Instead of exploring crates and frameworks, will be focusing on software development fundamentals.
